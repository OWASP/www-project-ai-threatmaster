The goal of OWASP AI-ThreatMaster is to assist teams in crafting more thorough threat models using OWASP top 10 methadology. It achieves this by harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models to generate lists of threats and mitigations. By incorporating AI into the threat modeling process, the tool achieves several key benefits:

**Standardization**: AI-ThreatMaster ensures consistency and standardization across the threat modeling process. By utilizing GPT models, it follows a structured approach to threat identification, analysis, and mitigation, streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency.

**Minimization of Human Bias** : Traditional threat modeling processes can be susceptible to human bias, leading to potential oversights or inaccuracies in threat identification. AI-ThreatMaster minimizes this bias by leveraging AI algorithms that analyze data objectively, reducing the risk of overlooking critical threats.

**Adaptive Learning**: AI-ThreatMaster continuously learns and evolves based on feedback and new data. This adaptive learning capability enables the platform to stay up-to-date with emerging threats and evolving attack vectors, ensuring that organizations are equipped to address the latest security challenges.
